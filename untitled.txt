Some people like to travel with a companion. Other people prefer to travel alone. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.

I think one of ways to compute value of lived life is count number of visited places in the world where we were traveled. I like traveling very much. When I was young I traveled with my mother, but last five-six years I traveled with my brother or alone. I think there are many good reasons to travel with a companion and to travel alone. So there they are.

When you travel with a companion you can rely on each other and decide who is responsible for what. It makes traveling more safety and comfortable. For example if you lost your credit card, passport, became ill or injured when you are alone, traveling may grow into a big trouble and even risk of death. Especially if you travel in Third World countries such as Cambodia or Nigeria. It also makes preparation to traveling more easier and you can save plenty of time.

In most of time, when you travel with your friend you may get many funs. He can take a picture for you. And you can share your happiness expiration with your friend.

On the other hand when you travel alone you are fully free. You can decide where to go and what to do. If you solve your troubles alone it makes you character more stronger. And you can check on what you really are. At least if traveling alone will become boring you can meet new friends and continue traveling with her or him.
